									<h3>Apply principles of sustainability to create viable systems</h3>

								<p>When I was working on the model rockets launcher, the first thing we learned from our predecessors' design that it was nearly impossible to repair if any important part failed. The reason was that the old design used complicated wiring, and it is easily tangled.
									So we made a requirement for our new design to be maintainable. We discussed different strategies and decided to design a PCB to replace most of the complicated wiring. We also made sure to leave well-documented schematics for our successors to build upon.
									We also noticed that the relays, an essential part of the whole device, are prone to wear and tear. So we come up with dedicated PCBs for the relays that allow easy plug/unplug to replace.
									The result was a maintainable design and product.</p>

								<p>In a recent rocketry competition held in the USA between universities all over the world, we had to design a transceiver device that will meet the standards of the USA in transmitting frequency. Understanding the importance of the task, my teammates and me formed a study group to support each other in getting a licence that allow us to design and operate such device. I looked for resources that could help us in studying and shared with the team in our study session. As a result, we all achieved our licences and went on designed and built a device that is compliant to the USA regulations and complete the task successfully at the competition.</p>
