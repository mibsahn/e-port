									<h3>Apply principles of sustainability to create viable systems</h3>
									<p>Maintainability is an importance aspect of sustainability.</p>
								</header>
								<p>When I was working on the model rockets launcher, the first thing we learned from our predecessors' design that it was nearly impossible to repair if any important part failed. The reason was that the old design used complicated wiring, and it is easily tangled.<br> 

									I was eager to tackle this challenge. Together with my teammates, we made a requirement for our new design to be maintainable. We discussed different strategies and decided to design a PCB to replace most of the complicated wiring. We also noticed that the relays, an essential part of the whole device, are prone to wear and tear. So we come up with dedicated PCBs for the relays that allow easy plug/unplug to replace.<br>
									
									We also made sure to leave well-documented schematics for our successors to build upon. I believe that documenting the progress and highlighting the critical design decisions helps spreading the value of sustainability we included in our design.<br>
									
									I realized that it takes an extra time and effort to include sustainability in our project. However, it is worthwhile as the project will be shared with other students and may be further built upon. Engineering Australia (2014) recommend to build shared community value, robustness, and resilience and I think we are doing well in that regards at UTS Rocketry Team. In the future, I believe that it is always good practice to think about sustainability in any project that I'll work on.</p>

									<h3>Professional Practice within intercultural and global contexts</h3>
									<p>Adhering to global technical standards.</p>
								</header>
								<p>In a recent rocketry competition held in the USA between universities all over the world, we had to design a transceiver device that will meet the standards of the USA in transmitting frequency.<br>
									I was excited but also lost in the vast amount of information provided in the competition brief. After doing some reasearch, I found a guideline on different transmission bands in the US and it helped me understand a little better the problem at hands. I looked further for resources that could help us in studying and shared them with the team in our study session. I believe that we must make proper preparation to attend a competition held in a foreign country with its own regulations.<br>
									For us, the biggest problems was the lack in hands-on experience in operating RF transmission devices, because it would require a licence the non of us have. However, through our team lead's network, we were able to request the help of a local amateur radio group. They came to our study session and helped us prepared ourselves to get an amateur radio licence that allow us to design and operate such device.<br>
									As a result, we all achieved our licences and went on designed and built a device that is compliant to the USA regulations and complete the task successfully at the competition.<br>
									Engineers Australia (2022) recommend to practise in accordance with legal and statutory requirements to demonstrate competency. I think we have made our best effort in the early stage to make sure the design and operation of our device followed all the regulations in the US. In any future project, I will do my best to understand the technical standards of the environment I am working in, or that my product will be operated in and make sure it is reflected in my work.</p>
